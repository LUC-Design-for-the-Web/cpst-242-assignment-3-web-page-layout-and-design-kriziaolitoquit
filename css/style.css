- How did you decide on your siteâ€™s color scheme? 
      Answer: This site will not be too bright or too dark. I want my site to be as clean and pleasing to the eyes. 
      I will be using summer shades such as yellow, green, blue and gray. The site will have the feeling of accessibility to potential customers
      as well as a sense of happiness when buying something for their furry friends.
- Provide me with the color palette you will use within your site and provide the hexadecimals values for each color.
      Answer: #FBC326, #1D7D9E
- What areas of your site will be impacted by your color choice? 
      Answer: Background color for the header will have yellow color, fonts will be on the shade of blue. 
- What font(s) will you use for the ```<body>```(default declarations), ```<p>``` and ```<h1> - <h6>```
      Answer: Verdana. It gives width and space which makes the web content clear and readable.
- What are the different weights and sizes of the heading and paragraph tags?
      Answer: Header would have the largest size in the document. Navigation bar would have a bold weight for distinction.
- What is your desired line-height, word-spacing, and letter-spacing?
      Answer: line-height: 15-20px; word-spacing: 1px; letter-spacing: normal
